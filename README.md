# Automated Dockerization and Pushing Docker Image to Docker Hub

This project demonstrates the automation of Dockerizing applications and pushing the Docker images to Docker Hub using CircleCI. The goal is to streamline the process of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) by automating Docker builds and uploads to Docker Hub.

## Features

- **Dockerization**: Automates the process of creating Docker images for applications.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Uses CircleCI to automate the Docker build process.
- **Push to Docker Hub**: Once the Docker image is built, it is automatically pushed to Docker Hub for easy access and deployment.
- **Modular Setup**: Uses a clean, maintainable structure for scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Docker**: Containerize applications into portable and isolated environments.
- **CircleCI**: Automates the continuous integration process, including building and pushing Docker images.
- **Docker Hub**: Public repository to store and share Docker images.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your local machine.
- **CircleCI Account**: Set up a CircleCI account and connect it to your GitHub repository.
- **Docker Hub Account**: Create a Docker Hub account to push your Docker images.
